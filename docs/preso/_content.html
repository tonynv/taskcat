## What is taskcat?
**taskcat** is a tool that tests AWS CloudFormation templates. It deploys your AWS
CloudFormation template in multiple AWS Regions and generates a report with a pass/fail
grade for each region. You can specify the regions and number of Availability Zones you
want to include in the test, and pass in parameter values from your AWS CloudFormation
template. taskcat is implemented as a Python class that you import, instantiate, and run.

taskcat was developed by the aws-ia team to test AWS CloudFormation templates
that automatically deploy workloads on AWS. Weâ€™re pleased to make the tool available to
all developers who want to validate their custom AWS CloudFormation templates across
AWS Regions

### CLI
The cli is self documenting by using `--help`. The most common use of taskcat is for
executing function tests of CloudFormation templates. The command for this is:

```bash
taskcat test run
```

add `--help to see the supported flags and arguments`
---

```bash

optional arguments:
  -h, --help          show this help message and exit
  -v, --version       show program's version number and exit
  -q, --quiet         reduce output to the minimum
  -d, --debug         adds debug output and tracebacks
  --profile _PROFILE  set the default profile used.

commands:
  delete - [ALPHA] Deletes an installed package in an AWS account/region
  deploy - [ALPHA] installs a stack into an AWS account/region
  lint - checks CloudFormation templates for issues using cfn-python-lint
  list - [ALPHA] lists taskcat jobs with active stacks
  package - packages lambda source files into zip files. If a dockerfile is present in asource folder, it will be run prior to zipping the contents
  test - Performs functional tests on CloudFormation templates.
  update-ami - Updates AMI IDs within CloudFormation templates
  upload - Uploads project to S3.
```

### Python
Taskcat can be imported into Python and used in the testing framework of your choice.
``` python
from taskcat.testing import CFNTest
test = CFNTest.from_file(project_root='./template_dir')
with test as stacks:
    # Calling 'with' or 'test.run()' will deploy the stacks.
    for stack in stacks:
        print(f"Testing {stack.name}")
        bucket_name = ""
        for output in stack.outputs:
            if output.key == "LogsBucketName":
                bucket_name = output.value
                break
        assert "logs" in bucket_name
        assert stack.region.name in bucket_name
        print(f"Created bucket: {bucket_name}")
```

### Config files
taskcat has several configuration files which can be used to set behaviors in a flexible way.

#### Global config
`~/.taskcat.yml` provides global settings that become defaults for all projects. Please see our [schema reference](docs/schema/taskcat_schema.html) for specific configuration options that are available.

#### Project config
`<PROJECT_ROOT>/.taskcat.yml` provides project specific configuration. Please see our [schema reference](docs/schema/taskcat_schema.html) for specific configuration options that are available.
---
#### Precedence

`~/.taskcat.yml`
```yaml
general:
  s3_bucket: my-globally-defined-bucket
  parameters:
    KeyPair: my-global-ec2-keypair
```
---

Given a simple project config:

```yaml
project:
  name: my-project
  regions:
  - us-east-2
tests:
  default:
    template: ./template.yaml
```
---

The effective test configuration would become:

```yaml
tests:
  default:
    template: ./template.yaml
    s3_bucket: my-globally-defined-bucket
    parameters:
      KeyPair: my-global-ec2-keypair
```

If any item is re-defined in a project it takes precedence over the global value.
Anything defined in a test takes precedence over what is defined in the project or
global configuration. with the **exception** of the `parameters` section which works in
reverse. For example, using the same global config as above, given this project config:

### Parameter overrides

Parameter Overrides were added to the taskcat to solve a couple of common problems. First, many
templates share common parameters that are unique to an AWS account, like a KeyPair name
or an S3 Bucket, overrides provided a way to store those centrally for all your projects.
Second, we didn't want to add sensitive data (usernames, passwords, tokens) to a git
repository. The idea was to store sensitive/unique data outside of a git repository, but still
execute a test using this data. To that end, *any parameter defined in the global config
will take precedence over the same parameter in a project-level config*.
